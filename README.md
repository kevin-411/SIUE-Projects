# SIUE-Projects
A place to feature code that I wrote while studying for my Bachelors at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

Each Folder is separated by classes and has all the code that I wrote throughout my Bachelors degree. However, there will be some places where things are probably not going to run and I'll slowly be fixing these issues.

For now here's a listing of selected programs I've featured over the years.
