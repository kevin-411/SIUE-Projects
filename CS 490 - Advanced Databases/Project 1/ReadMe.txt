Read me:
To run the program we need to generate the input files so we need to set the correct settings and run dataMaker that uses the wordlist and generates random values to make a file of great size. We specify anywhere from 10MB to 1GB

We did our program in Python on Windows. 
Due to the fact that we implemented it on Windows the longs that our data-maker produces are only 4 bytes 
instead of the 8 that your program expects.
