To run this just do the same as you would in your plotter

	project3.py [lines file] [optional points file]

the output for the updated lines is labeled outputLines.txt

so you can look at the updated files as

	plotter.py outputLines.txt points_out.txt

I have all the training sets included so just copy them from their respective folders

If you want to look at the test sets to address specific bugs map under BUGS and under each folder

there should be test.txt and testPoints.txt files use the test.txt run them as

	project3.py test.txt testPoints.txt

the output is still outputLines.txt

Happy Grading.
