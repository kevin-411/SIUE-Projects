What Worked?
Brendan and I have a very good team dynamic and have already worked with eachother on past projects. Where one of us doesn't understand something the other can ussually have a good enough grasp to help understand concepts.

What did not work?
We both let this project slip until the last minute and pushed it off longer than it needed to be.

What were you responsible for in the project?
We didn't necessarily split up the tasks we just incrementally worked on it and kept eachother up to date but responsiblities were to some extent:

Brain: Code
Brendan: Pre-Lab questions and design. 

However this was just a general idea and we equally disbursed between coding and questions/design.

What could be done differently next time?

Be proactive about turning in the assignment. Maybe set a specific set of tasks that Brendan and I will accomplish individually and together.
