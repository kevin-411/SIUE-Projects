What Worked?
Brendan and I have a very good team dynamic and have already worked with eachother on past projects. Where one of us doesn't understand something the other can ussually have a good enough grasp to help understand concepts.

What did not work?
We learned not to second guess the software before second guessing ourselves. We also needed to code neater.

What were you responsible for in the project?
We didn't necessarily split up the tasks we just incrementally worked on it and kept eachother up to date but responsiblities were to some extent:

Brian: Code
Brendan: Pre-Lab questions and design. 

However this was just a general idea and we equally disbursed between coding and questions/design.

What could be done differently next time?

Assume the error is your code before jumping to conclusions it's not your code. Neater code.
