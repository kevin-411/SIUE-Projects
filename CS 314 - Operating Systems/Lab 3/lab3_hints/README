Instructions for hints:

1) Add the following to your traps.h...

#define TRAP_PRINT_QUEUE 0x465

2) Add the following to your traps.c (immediately after the code for
TRAP_COND_BROADCAST)...

case TRAP_PRINT_QUEUE:
PrintAllQueues();
break;

3) Add the contents of trap_helper to the end of usertraps.s

4) Add the contents of helper to the end of process.c

5) In your PCB, make sure you have a float/double field called estcpu
   In your PCB, also make sure you have a float/double field called
   priority.
   Make the change in process.h

6) Once you've completed steps 1-5, you're ready to go! Use the
provided Makefile to get things rolling.


7) To actually run the testcases, do the following...
cd ../execs
dlxsim -x os.dlx.obj -a -u testprog.dlx.obj <1,2,3 or 4>

The numbers at the end specify which testcase you wish to run.

You will also find my outputs for the 4 testcases in the archive.

Toodles.
