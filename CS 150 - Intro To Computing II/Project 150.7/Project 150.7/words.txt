One
is
the
loneliest
number
in
the
world
Two
is
company
three
a
crowd
If
you
can't
take
the
heat
get
out
of
the
kitchen
A
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
starts
with
a
single
step
We
fail
our
way
to
success
Bookstores
are
filled
with
two
kinds
of
cook
books
those
that
tell
you
how
to
prepare
food
and
those
that
tell
you
what
you
can't
have
Two
wrongs
don't
make
it
right
