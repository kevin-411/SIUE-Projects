Things to change:
	- can you make it where all forms open in the center of its parent (direction form, )
	- on directions: either show the room number of the destination or highlight it on the map
	- on view rooms: it says whose office it is on the button, but it doesn't show the same info as when
		you click on that person from the faculty/staff page
	- loading the room info and such would probably go faster if we use the release version instead of the debug.
		However, for the release version, we would need to copy the needed info to the release folder(pictures, database, etc.?).

There was a couple of times that some of the info looked incorrect, but I think that that is just the database being incomplete.
Other than that, looks great!!
