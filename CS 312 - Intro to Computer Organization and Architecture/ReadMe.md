#LearnOBA: Senior Project#

###**Class:** CS 425 & CS 499 &ndash; Senior Project: Software Design &amp Software Implementation.###

**Program Description:** LearnOBA ([Learning Outcomes Based Assessment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome-based_education "LearnOBA")) is a grading system that was designed to assist educators with maintaining a grade book that guided them to strictly adhere to the Learning Outcomes Bases Assessment paradigm.

**Comments:** The primary challenge with this project was getting the final builds multi-platform (OS X, Windows, and Linux). We wrote the software in Java to avoid redundant writing of code but still ran into many compliance issues in the end.
